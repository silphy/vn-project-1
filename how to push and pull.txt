Navigating to the folder
You can right click in the folder and click "Git Bash Here"

Alternatively, you can navigate to the folder manually.

cd ../  
moves you up one file space

D:
moves you to D drive.

dir
lists directory

ls
also lists directory

cd foldername
navigates you into foldername


cd fold + tab
tab will autocomplete foldernames if there are no folders that it can be confused with

pushing

git add .
git commit -m "add your message about the commit here"
git push origin master
(you can replace master with whatever branch you want to be on)


pulling
git pull 
or
git pull origin master
(again you can replace master with the branch)
